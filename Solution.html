          <p class="text-white">Tor is a software that secures user privacy by sending their requests to a website through multiple servers located around the world, called relays. The use of tor and its relays completely hide the user’s identity, allowing for secure, safe browsing. Tor is a double edged sword, it allows for people to maintain their privacy and access the internet in areas with strict laws. </p>
          <p class="text-white">Tor is a double edged sword. It uses relays all around the world to scramble traffic, completely hiding the user's identity. Tor can access normal websites, but one of its best features is its ability to access .onion sites. Onion sites are sites only accessible from Tor and not indexed by search engines, and when people refer to the “dark web” they really mean Tor and its onion sites. While this is amazing for those who want an extra level of security or live in a region with internet censorship, Tor is also a safe haven for criminals, and piracy, drug deals, and many more forms of crime go down over Tor.</p>
          <p class="text-white">The best way to stop crime is to prevent it from ever occurring. The bot works by sending out http get requests through the tor proxies. What do the tor proxies do? They scramble the identity of the bot and they allow it to access .onion sites. All of this is done using a Python library, and the results are then sent back to the user through a flask website, which provides a dashboard that gives significant information about the tags the website uses as well as the words it uses. This is important as it cuts away most of the clutter on a website. If modified and applied properly, police would be able to use this in a real situation since it can access the real dark web and has the capability to analyze it. So while it does not go to random websites now, due to security reasons, it has the full capacity to do so in the future. We believe that using this technology, police would be able to cut down cyber crime significantly, as it prevents criminals from accessing illicit items before they even have the opportunity to do so.</p>
